## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Critical Fixes

#### S3 Storage Architecture Refinement
**Impact:** Medium - Improves reliability and simplifies codebase

**What Was Fixed:**
- Limited S3 storage usage to version management operations only
- Removed S3 draft lookup from primary chatflow retrieval
- Eliminated race conditions between S3 and database
- Simplified `getChatflowById` signature by removing `useDraft` parameter

**Technical Details:**
- S3 is now exclusively used for:
  - Version listing
  - Version retrieval
  - Version rollback operations
- All active chatflow operations now use database as single source of truth
- Removed `useDraft` parameter from API endpoints
- Updated controller calls to consistently use database

**Why This Matters:**
Previously, the system would check both S3 and database for draft states, creating potential inconsistencies. This change ensures:
- More predictable behavior
- Better performance (fewer S3 calls)
- Reduced complexity
- Clearer separation of concerns

**Files Changed:**
- `packages/server/src/controllers/chatflows/index.ts`
- `packages/server/src/services/chatflows/index.ts`

---

#### Database Rollback Operation Fix
**Impact:** High - Prevents data loss during version rollback

**What Was Fixed:**
- Fixed flowData not updating in database during rollback operations
- Ensured rollback operations properly sync between S3 versions and database

**Technical Details:**
- Added database update step during version rollback
- Ensures `flowData` field is properly updated when rolling back to previous version
- Maintains consistency between version storage and active chatflow state

**Why This Matters:**
Previously, rolling back to a previous version would update references but not the actual flow data, causing confusion and potential data loss.

---

### Code Quality Improvements

#### ESLint Compliance
**Impact:** Low - Code quality and maintainability

**What Was Fixed:**
- Fixed linting errors across multiple files
- Improved code consistency
- Updated ESLint configuration for better coverage
- Resolved React hook dependencies warnings
- Fixed prototype pollution vulnerability (Code Scanning Alert #202)

**Files Changed:**
- Multiple files across `packages/docs`, `packages-answers/ui`, and `packages/components`
- Added `.eslintignore` patterns for better control
- Updated workflow configurations

---

## üîß Technical Improvements

### Dependency Updates
- Added `replicate` package for AI model integrations
- Updated various package versions for security and compatibility
- Added new video generation dependencies

### API Architecture
- New video generator service layer with LangFuse tracking
- Enhanced error handling in video generation pipeline
- Improved billing event tracking for video usage

### Database Schema
- No schema changes in this release (backwards compatible)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

### S3 Storage API Changes (Minor)

**Affected API:**
- `getChatflowById(id, useDraft)` ‚Üí `getChatflowById(id)`

**Migration Guide:**
If you were using the `useDraft` parameter in custom integrations:

**Before:**
```javascript
const chatflow = await getChatflowById(chatflowId, true)  // Get draft from S3
```

**After:**
```javascript
const chatflow = await getChatflowById(chatflowId)  // Always uses database
```

**Impact Assessment:**
- **Internal API only** - Does not affect external integrations
- Most users won't need to make any changes
- If you have custom server modifications that call this function, update your calls
