**Q: What are Global Variables?**

Global Variables are reusable values that can be accessed across all your workflows in AnswerAgent. They're perfect for storing configuration, API keys, database URLs, and other data you want to use in multiple places without having to redefine them each time.

**Benefits of Global Variables:**

-   **Centralized Management**: Store values in one place
-   **Reusability**: Use the same values across multiple workflows
-   **Security**: Safely store sensitive information
-   **Maintainability**: Change values once, update everywhere
-   **Organization**: Keep configuration separate from workflow logic

**Get Started**: [Create your first variable](/sidekick-studio/variables)

> > > > > >

**Q: What types of Global Variables are available?**

AnswerAgent supports two main types of Global Variables:

**Static Variables:**

-   **Direct Storage**: Values stored directly in AnswerAgent
-   **Simple Management**: Easy to create and modify through the interface
-   **Immediate Access**: Available instantly across all workflows
-   **Version Control**: Changes are tracked and can be reverted

**Runtime Variables:**

-   **Environment-based**: Values fetched from environment variables (.env file)
-   **Security-focused**: Ideal for sensitive data like API keys
-   **Deployment-aware**: Different values for development/staging/production
-   **External Management**: Managed outside of AnswerAgent interface

**Configure**: [Set up variables](/sidekick-studio/variables) and [manage credentials](/sidekick-studio/credentials)

> > > > > >

**Q: How do I create and manage Global Variables?**

Creating Global Variables is straightforward:

**Creating Variables:**

1. **Navigate**: Go to [Sidekick Studio → Global Variables](/sidekick-studio/variables)
2. **Add New**: Click 'Add New Variable'
3. **Configure**: Set name, type, and value
4. **Save**: Store the variable for use

**Configuration Options:**

-   **Variable Name**: Use clear, descriptive names (e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY, DATABASE_URL)
-   **Variable Type**: Choose between Static or Runtime
-   **Variable Value**: Set the actual value or environment variable reference
-   **Description**: Add notes explaining the variable's purpose
-   **Scope**: Set organization or user-level access

**Manage**: [Create variables](/sidekick-studio/variables) and [configure settings](/sidekick-studio/variables)

> > > > > >

**Q: How do I use Global Variables in my workflows?**

Global Variables can be used throughout your workflows:

**Variable Reference Syntax:**

-   **Basic Usage**: `$vars.VARIABLE_NAME`
-   **In Custom Tools**: `const apiKey = $vars.OPENAI_API_KEY;`
-   **In Prompts**: `{{$vars.API_KEY}}`
-   **In Node Configuration**: Reference in any input field that accepts variables

**Examples:**

```javascript
// In a custom tool
const apiKey = $vars.OPENAI_API_KEY
const databaseUrl = $vars.DATABASE_URL
const appConfig = $vars.APP_SETTINGS

// In a prompt template
;('Use the API key: {{$vars.API_KEY}} to make requests')

// In node configuration
BaseURL: $vars.API_BASE_URL
Timeout: $vars.REQUEST_TIMEOUT
```

**Use**: [Add to your workflows](/sidekick-studio/chatflows) and [configure tools](/sidekick-studio/tools)

**Q: What are the security best practices for Global Variables?**

Follow these security practices when using Global Variables:

**For Sensitive Data:**

-   **Use Runtime Variables**: Store secrets in environment variables, not static variables
-   **Environment Separation**: Different .env files for dev/staging/production
-   **Limited Access**: Restrict who can view/modify sensitive variables
-   **Regular Rotation**: Change API keys and secrets periodically

**Naming Conventions:**

-   **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, consistent naming (e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY, not KEY1)
-   **Environment Prefixes**: Consider DEV*, STAGING*, PROD\_ prefixes
-   **Type Indicators**: Use suffixes like \_API_KEY, \_URL, \_CONFIG

**Access Control:**

-   **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only grant necessary access
-   **Regular Audits**: Review who has access to what variables
-   **Documentation**: Keep records of what each variable is used for

**Secure**: [Manage API keys](/sidekick-studio/apikey) and [configure credentials](/sidekick-studio/credentials)
