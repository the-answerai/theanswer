        {
            question: "We've already tried AI pilots that went nowhere. How is this different?",
            answer: "That's the GenAI Divide in action â€” 95% of pilots fail because they use static systems without learning capability or proper integration. We focus on adaptive AI with memory and feedback loops, plus the deep services to embed it into your actual workflows. Our approach addresses the root causes MIT identified: the learning gap and lack of workflow integration."
        },
        {
            question: "Isn't this just more hype? How do we know you can deliver real results?",
            answer: "We start with pragmatic, back-office use cases where AI has proven ROI â€” finance, procurement, HR automation. MIT research shows these deliver higher returns than flashy front-office pilots. We'll show you exactly how organizations like yours achieved measurable results by focusing on practical automation first."
        },
        {
            question: 'Should we build this internally or work with a partner?',
            answer: 'MIT data shows external partnerships succeed at 2x the rate of internal builds (67% vs 33%). Most internal projects stall due to stretched teams, evolving AI landscape, and complex integrations. Partners bring specialized expertise, faster deployment, and continuous updates so you can focus on your business, not becoming an AI company.'
        },
        {
            question: 'What about Shadow AI? Our employees are already using ChatGPT â€” should we ban it?',
            answer: 'Shadow AI affects 90% of companies and banning rarely works long-term. The better approach: provide sanctioned, enterprise-grade AI tools that are just as easy to use but secure, compliant, and learning-capable. Give employees what they need within governance boundaries rather than driving them underground.'
        },
        {
            question: 'How do we handle security and compliance with AI?',
            answer: 'This is exactly why Shadow AI is so dangerous â€” employees using unsanctioned tools bypass all your controls. We help you deploy enterprise-grade AI with proper governance, audit trails, data residency, and compliance frameworks. Your data stays in your environment with full visibility and control.'
        },
        {
            question: 'Will this webinar be another vendor pitch?',
            answer: "No â€” this is an educational session based on MIT research and real implementation experience. We'll share the framework that separates the successful 5% from the failing 95%, whether you work with us or not. Our goal is to help you avoid pilot purgatory and achieve real AI transformation."
