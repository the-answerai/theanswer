# Requirements for MVP Spike: Usage Tracking System with Stripe Billing Integration

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements for implementing an MVP version of the usage tracking system. The primary focus is on extending the existing Langfuse trace integration to include Stripe billing with meters. The implementation should demonstrate end-to-end functionality and serve as a proof of concept.

---

## Analysis of the Existing System

### Langfuse Integration

-   Tracks traces, spans, and events for chains, LLMs, and tools.
-   Provides automatic metadata collection (e.g., Chatflow ID, User ID, Session ID).
-   Handles retries and error management internally.

### Key Relationships:

-   Langfuse captures usage events, while Stripe processes billing based on those events.
-   Metadata from Langfuse traces is essential for accurate billing.
-   New endpoints and dependencies are required for synchronizing Langfuse data with Stripe meters.

---

## New Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Usage Tracking Enhancements:**

    - Collect additional metadata (Customer ID, subscription tier, usage quotas, and cost center).
    - Categorize usage types (LLM, compute, storage).

2. **Stripe Integration:**

    - Synchronize usage data with Stripe meters.
    - Send data on a 1:1 basis, aligning Stripe events directly with Langfuse traces unless aggregation is absolutely required.
    - Support invoicing, subscription, and customer management.

3. **Error Handling:**

    - Implement robust error recovery mechanisms for failed Stripe updates.
    - Ensure trace data consistency during retries.

4. **Customer Authentication and Management:**

    - Seamless integration with Auth0 for user authentication.
    - Link Auth0 user IDs to Stripe customer records without duplicating data.

5. **Monitoring & Alerts:**

    - Detect anomalies in usage spikes.
    - Notify thresholds nearing quota limits.

6. **Webhooks:**

    - Implement Stripe webhooks to track payment failures, subscription changes, and usage quota breaches.

## Updated Approach: Langfuse-to-Stripe Sync Mechanism

### Core Process

1. **Sparks Conversion Logic:**

    - **Definition:** "Sparks" is a virtual currency representing usage costs across AI tokens, compute time, and storage.
    - **Conversion Table:**
        - AI Tokens: 1,000 tokens = 100 Sparks ($0.10)
        - Compute Time: 1 minute = 50 Sparks ($0.05)
        - Storage: 1 GB/month = 500 Sparks ($0.50)
    - **Implementation:**
        - Each Langfuse trace includes metadata (e.g., tokens used, compute duration, storage size).
        - Conversion logic maps usage metrics to Sparks using a multiplier.
        - This conversion is executed within the integration layer before syncing with Stripe.

2. **Pricing Management:**

    - **Flat Pricing:**
        - Sparks have a fixed conversion rate to USD ($0.001 per Spark).
    - **Volume Discounts (Optional):**
        - Predefined discount tiers (e.g., 5% for over 10,000 Sparks).
        - Managed via pricing configuration or Stripe discount objects.
    - **Configuration:**
        - Pricing is centrally managed in an environment variable or JSON file.
        - Example:
            ```json
            {
                "spark_rate": 0.001,
                "volume_discounts": [{ "threshold": 10000, "discount": 0.05 }]
            }
            ```

3. **Monthly Billing Cycle Logic:**

    - **Cycle Definition:**
        - Usage is aggregated for each customer starting on the 1st of each month.
        - Billing resets at midnight UTC on the last day of the month.
    - **Implementation:**
        - A scheduler runs daily to ensure usage is properly tracked.
        - At the end of the cycle:
            1. All accumulated Sparks are synced with Stripe as metered usage.
            2. Invoices are generated automatically via Stripe.
    - **Proration:**
        - Stripe handles mid-cycle changes (e.g., subscription upgrades) using prorated calculations.

4. **Usage Reports for Customers:**

    - **Purpose:** Provide transparency on usage and costs.
    - **Report Content:**
        - Breakdown by resource type (AI tokens, compute, storage).
        - Total Sparks consumed and equivalent cost in USD.
        - Current subscription tier and remaining quotas.
    - **Delivery:**
        - Access through a `GET /usage/report` API endpoint.
        - Optionally include monthly email reports.
    - **Example Response:**
        ```json
        {
            "customer_id": "cust_123",
            "usage_summary": {
                "ai_tokens": { "used": 5000, "sparks": 500 },
                "compute_time": { "used": 120, "sparks": 600 },
                "storage": { "used": 2, "sparks": 1000 }
            },
            "total_sparks": 2100,
            "total_cost_usd": 2.1
        }
        ```

5. **Subscription Tier Feature Access:**

    - **Tiers Definition:**
        - Free: Limited to 10,000 Sparks/month, basic feature set.
        - Standard: Unlimited Sparks, advanced workflows.
        - Enterprise: Unlimited Sparks, custom SLAs.
    - **Feature Restrictions:**
        - Use feature flags to control access based on the subscription tier.
        - Implement restrictions server-side (e.g., API rate limits, feature toggles).
    - **Integration with Auth0:**
        - Use Auth0 roles or metadata to link users to their subscription tier.
        - Fetch subscription details dynamically from Stripe and store minimally in Auth0 profiles.

6. **Webhook Handling:**

    - Receive Stripe webhooks for events like payment failures, subscription updates, and invoice generation.
    - Process these webhooks to adjust internal logic dynamically (e.g., pausing accounts on failed payments).
