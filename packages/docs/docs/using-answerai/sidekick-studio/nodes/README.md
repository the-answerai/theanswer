# Sidekick Studio Nodes

The AnswerAI Sidekick Studio provides a powerful canvas for building generative AI applications through a variety of specialized nodes. These nodes are organized into distinct categories, enabling users to create sophisticated workflows with ease.

## Overview

Sidekick Studio Nodes are the building blocks of your AI workflows. Each node represents a specific functionality or component that can be connected to others, allowing you to create complex AI-powered applications without writing code.

## Key Benefits

-   **Modular Design**: Mix and match different nodes to create custom AI solutions.
-   **Visual Workflow**: Easily understand and modify your AI processes through a graphical interface.
-   **Extensive Functionality**: Access a wide range of AI capabilities through specialized nodes.

## How to Use

1. Open the Sidekick Studio in your AnswerAI dashboard.
2. Drag and drop nodes from the sidebar onto the canvas.
3. Connect nodes by drawing lines between their input and output ports.
4. Configure each node by clicking on it and adjusting its settings in the properties panel.
5. Test your workflow using the built-in debugging tools.
