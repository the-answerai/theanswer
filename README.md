## ‚ö°Quick Start

Since TheAnswer is built on top of Flowise, you can start by using Flowise and then integrate TheAnswer features.

Download and Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) >= 18.15.0

1. Install Flowise
    ```bash
    npm install -g flowise
    ```
2. Start Flowise

    ```bash
    npx flowise start
    ```

    With username & password

    ```bash
    npx flowise start --FLOWISE_USERNAME=user --FLOWISE_PASSWORD=1234
    ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Note: The TheAnswer package is currently under development and not yet published to npm. Stay tuned for updates on when it will be available as a standalone CLI tool.

## üê≥ Docker

### Docker Compose

1. Go to `docker` folder at the root of the project
2. Copy `.env.example` file, paste it into the same location, and rename to `.env`
3. `docker compose up -d`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
5. You can bring the containers down by `docker compose stop`

### Docker Image

1. Build the image locally:
    ```bash
    docker build --no-cache -t flowise .
    ```
2. Run image:

    ```bash
    docker run -d --name flowise -p 3000:3000 flowise
    ```

3. Stop image:
    ```bash
    docker stop flowise
    ```

## üë®‚Äçüíª Developers

TheAnswer is built on top of Flowise and extends its functionality. The project structure is as follows:

### Packages (from Flowise)

All packages inside `packages/*` are from the original Flowise project:

-   `server`: Node backend to serve API logics
-   `ui`: React frontend
-   `components`: Third-party nodes integrations
-   `embed`: Embedding functionality
-   `embed-react`: React components for embedding
-   `flowise-configs`: Configuration files for Flowise

### Packages-Answers (TheAnswer-specific)

TheAnswer adds additional functionality through the `packages-answers/*` directory:

-   `db`: Database interactions
-   `eslint-config-custom`: Custom ESLint configuration
-   `experimental-prisma-webpack-plugin`: Experimental Prisma plugin for Webpack
-   `tsconfig`: TypeScript configuration
-   `types`: Shared type definitions
-   `ui`: TheAnswer-specific UI components
-   `utils`: Utility functions

This structure allows TheAnswer to build upon Flowise's core functionality while adding its own features and customizations.

### Prerequisite

-   Install [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation)
    ```bash
    npm i -g pnpm
    ```

### Setup

1.  Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/the-answerai/theanswer.git
    ```

2.  Go into repository folder

    ```bash
    cd theanswer
    ```

3.  Install all dependencies of all modules:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

4.  Build all the code:

    ```bash
    pnpm build
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>Exit code 134 (JavaScript heap out of memory)</summary>  
      If you get this error when running the above `build` script, try increasing the Node.js heap size and run the script again:

        export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096"
        pnpm build

    </details>

5.  Start the app:

    ```bash
    pnpm start
    ```

    You can now access the app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

6.  For development build:

    -   Create `.env` file and specify the `VITE_PORT` (refer to `.env.example`) in `packages/ui`
    -   Create `.env` file and specify the `PORT` (refer to `.env.example`) in `packages/server`
    -   Run

        ```bash
        pnpm dev
        ```

    Any code changes will reload the app automatically on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## üîí Authentication

To enable app level authentication, add `FLOWISE_USERNAME` and `FLOWISE_PASSWORD` to the `.env` file in `packages/server`:
