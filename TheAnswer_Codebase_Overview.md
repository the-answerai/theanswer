# TheAnswer Codebase Overview

## Introduction

TheAnswer is a revolutionary AI-powered productivity suite built on top of Flowise, extending it with additional capabilities and integrations. This document provides a detailed overview of the codebase, explaining the main components and how they interact with each other.

## Project Architecture

TheAnswer follows a monorepo structure using pnpm workspaces, which consists of three main directories:

1. `packages/` - Contains the original Flowise packages
2. `packages-answers/` - Contains TheAnswer-specific packages that extend Flowise functionality
3. `apps/` - Contains the end-user applications

The project uses Turborepo for managing the monorepo build system, allowing for efficient dependency management and build optimization.
