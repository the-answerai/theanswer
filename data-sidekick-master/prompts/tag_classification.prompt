	Billing Confusions/Inquiry (payment-billing-confusions-inquiry)

	Rentals & Reservations (rentals-reservations)

	Staffing / HR (additional-staffing-hr)

Instruction: Classify the provided call transcript using as many of the category and subcategory slugs as apply. You may choose multiple if the content suggests more than one (for example, if a customer both complains about late fees and also wants a refund, you might include payment-billing-late-overdue and payment-billing-refunds-credits). Return your answer as a list or array of slugs that best match the call or user statement, maintaining the hierarchy if possible.

Important Rules:
	1.	Provide only slugs that are clearly applicable based on the text.
	2.	You do not have to provide a slug for the top-level category if a subcategory is already identified. However, some use cases might require both. (E.g., you can return ["payment-billing", "payment-billing-late-overdue"] if you want to indicate the parent-child relationship, or you can just provide the subcategory if your system is designed that way.)
	3.	If nothing in the text matches any category, return an empty list or a special notation such as ["none"].
	4.	Do not invent slugs not found in the list.
	5.	If multiple categories apply, return them all.

Examples:
	•	Transcript: "I was charged a late fee even though its only been three days."
	•	Answer: [ "payment-billing-late-overdue" ]
	•	Transcript: "Im moving out next week. Do I get a pro-rated refund?"
	•	Answer: [ "rentals-move-in-move-out", "payment-billing-refunds-credits" ]
	•	Transcript: "I love how helpful the staff was. Thank you!"
	•	Answer: [ "customer-service-positive" ]

Return your final classification as a JSON-like array of slug strings (e.g., ["rentals-new-reservation", "customer-service-escalation-followup"]).
